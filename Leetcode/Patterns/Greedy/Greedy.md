## ðŸ§  Overview

Greedy algorithms build a solution step by step by always choosing the **locally optimal choice**, without considering future consequences.

Used when:

- A local optimum leads to a global optimum (greedy-choice property)
    
- Backtracking or memoization is unnecessary
    
- We can make progress with minimal state tracking
